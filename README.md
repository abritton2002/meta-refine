# Meta-Refine 🚀

**An intelligent code review and improvement system powered by Llama 3.1**

## 🎯 Vision

Meta-Refine leverages Meta's Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct model to provide intelligent, context-aware code analysis and improvement suggestions. This system demonstrates advanced AI/ML engineering, software architecture, and developer experience design.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Multi-Dimensional Code Analysis
- **Bug Detection**: Identify potential runtime errors, logic flaws, and edge cases
- **Performance Optimization**: Suggest algorithmic improvements and efficiency gains
- **Security Analysis**: Detect vulnerabilities and security anti-patterns
- **Best Practices**: Enforce coding standards and architectural principles
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate comprehensive docstrings and comments

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support
- Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust
- Language-specific analysis patterns and optimization suggestions
- Framework-aware recommendations (React, Django, Spring, etc.)

### 🎨 Advanced Features
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understands project structure and dependencies
- **Learning System**: Improves suggestions based on user feedback
- **Integration Ready**: CLI, VS Code extension, GitHub Actions
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze entire codebases efficiently
- **Custom Rules**: Define organization-specific coding standards

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Model Interface**: Optimized Llama 3.1 integration with custom prompting
2. **Code Parser**: AST-based analysis with semantic understanding
3. **Rule Engine**: Extensible pattern matching and suggestion system
4. **Feedback Loop**: Continuous learning from user interactions
5. **Output Formatter**: Beautiful, actionable improvement reports

### Performance Optimizations
- **Streaming Inference**: Real-time analysis with progressive results
- **Context Chunking**: Intelligent code segmentation for large files
- **Caching Layer**: Avoid redundant analysis of unchanged code
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded analysis for speed

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Quick setup with uv
make quick-start

# Or manual setup:
# 1. Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# 2. Set up environment
make setup-env
# Edit .env file and add your HF_TOKEN from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

# 3. Run analysis on example files
python3 meta_refine.py analyze --file examples/example.py

# 4. Run on entire project
python3 meta_refine.py analyze --project ./examples

# 5. Run system health check
python3 meta_refine.py doctor
```

## 📊 Example Output

```
🔍 Analysis Results for `user_service.py`

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (2)
├─ Line 45: SQL Injection vulnerability in user query
├─ Line 78: Unhandled exception could crash service

⚡ PERFORMANCE (3)
├─ Line 23: O(n²) algorithm can be optimized to O(n log n)
├─ Line 67: Unnecessary database call in loop
├─ Line 102: Memory leak in file handling

✨ SUGGESTIONS (5)
├─ Line 15: Consider using dataclasses for User model
├─ Line 34: Add input validation for email format
├─ Line 89: Extract method to improve readability
├─ Line 95: Add type hints for better IDE support
├─ Line 110: Consider async/await for I/O operations

📝 DOCUMENTATION
├─ Missing docstring for UserService class
├─ Function `validate_user` needs parameter documentation
├─ Add usage examples in module docstring
```
